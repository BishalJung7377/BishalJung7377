## 🚀 About Me  

Results-driven **Senior Data Engineer** with 7+ years of experience designing and operating secure, scalable, and high-performance data platforms across **finance, healthcare, and telecommunications**.

I specialize in **cloud-native data engineering** on **AWS, Azure, and GCP**, building modern ETL/ELT pipelines, streaming systems, and analytical data platforms using **Spark, Snowflake, Databricks, Python, and SQL**.

I’ve led migrations from legacy systems to cloud, implemented **real-time fraud monitoring**, built governed data lakes and warehouses, and supported **advanced analytics and machine learning workflows** in regulated environments (HIPAA, SOX, GDPR).

I’m passionate about:
- Data platform modernization  
- Scalable pipeline architecture  
- Data quality & governance  
- Cloud cost optimization  
- Mentoring engineers and building high-performance data teams
